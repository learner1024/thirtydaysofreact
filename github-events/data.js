Theoretically, the comparison grid can be specified in the config, though presently we are not interpolating sea-ice observations, so the comparison grid must be the 0.5 degree global grid.\r\n\r\nInterpolation is performed in 2 steps, first creating mapping files (if they do not already exist) using `ESMF_RegridWeightGen` and second performing remapping of data using `ncremap`.\r\n\r\nNew helper functions have been added to create the SCRIP files needed to create mapping files with `ESMF_RegridWeightGen`.\r\n\r\nAll config files have been updated to include a new 'mapping' output subdirectory as well as several new config options related to climatologies:\r\n* `lat`, `lon` - the latitude and longitude of the comparison grid\r\n* `latLonUnits` - the units of lat and lon\r\n* `mpasMappingFile` - the path to a mapping file if one exists,\r\n                      otherwise the default `mpasClimatologyMapping.nc`\r\n* `overwriteMapping`, `overwriteClimatology` - flags for overwriting files\r\n* `modelInterpolationMethod`, `obsInterpolationMethod` - interpolation order\r\n\r\nUnit tests have been added to test horizontal interpolation."
